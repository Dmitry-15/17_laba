Are you interested in the behaviour of people and animals? If you are, then you might enjoy the study of psychology. 
Psychology is the study of behaviour, but this is a very large area of study. There are several different branches of psychology, 
each of which studies a different aspect of behaviour.
Social psychologists study interactions among people. For example, a social psychologist might try to learn about the situations 
that cause people to behave aggressively. Another question studied by social psychologists is 
why certain people become attracted 
to each other. One of the interesting problems in social psychology is conformity: what causes people to 
behave in the same way, 
and to follow what others do and say?
Cognitive psychologists study thinking, memory, and language. One problem studied by cognitive psychologists is how 
people remember numbers. 
For example, what is the best way to memorise some numbers? Is it better to repeat the numbers to oneself, or to try to attach some meaning 
to these numbers? A cognitive psychologist might also study language. For example, why can young children learn a second language 
so quickly? 
Cognitive psychologists are also interested in the ways that people learn to solve problems, such as finding a new place.
Clinical psychologists study mental illnesses. For example, a clinical psychologist might try to find out 
the causes of depression and 
to figure out ways of helping people who are depressed. Other clinical psychologists might study the behaviour of people who suffer from 
addiction to drugs, so that this problem can be prevented and treated. Another topic of interest to clinical psychologists is violent behaviour.
